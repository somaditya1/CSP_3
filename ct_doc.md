# Overview/Initial Plan
My Create Task project has users choose an option that will then be pinned against the computer option. The various options are rock, paper and scissors. Based of chance the computer will either win or lose. Rock beats scissors. Scissors will beat paper and finally, paper will beat rock If both computer and player pick the same item, the result would be a tie. In the end, the result would be displayed for each round. Each game has 10 rounds and the score is displayed at the top. Whichever player has more winning rounds wins the game.
* The user will enter an input
* There will be three possible inputs in the data collection
* Iteration in code with for loops
* There will be an output displaying a result.
* Sequencing code will occur in order.
