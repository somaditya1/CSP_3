# Overview/Initial Plan
My Create Task project has users choose an option that will then be pinned against the computer option. The various options are rock, paper and scissors. Based of chance the computer will either win or lose. Rock beats scissors. Scissors will beat paper and finally, paper will beat rock If both computer and player pick the same item, the result would be a tie. In the end, the result would be displayed for each round. Each game has 10 rounds and the score is displayed at the top. Whichever player has more winning rounds wins the game.
* The user will enter an input
* There will be three possible inputs in the data collection
* Iteration in code with for loops
* There will be an output displaying a result.
* Sequencing code will occur in order.

## Part a
### i
The overall purpose of the program is for the person to play a game of chance with a computer to help them decide whether to do something or even simply just for fun.
### ii
The user interface of the game is shown in the video featured above. There is a scoreboard and a counter for the number of remaining rounds.
### iii
The input is either rock, paper and scissors and the output is whether the user won. The computer choice occurs in the background and the final result is shown at the very end based of whomever won the most amount of rounds. 
## part b

This shows data being stored and an optimal result taking place afterwards.

The result is determined by this snippet of code
### iii
The list would be the playGame() part of the code, as it stores many necessary aspects.
###  iv 
The list contains the various possibilities in an if then conditional form
###  v
The list makes the program more complex because of its ability to vary and hold a various amount of information.
## part c

The function was defined in this situation. The purpose for this was to determine who would win.
### ii
The player scoreboard is the name

### iii
This function takes the number of rounds the computer won over time and displays them up top.

The logic is being tested for what beats what. The result will determine the outcome.
