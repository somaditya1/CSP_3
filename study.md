## 5.1 Notes
Essential Knowledge (Video 1):

People create computing innovations
The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
A signal effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts Essential Knowledge (Video 2):
Computing innovations can have an impact beyond its intended purpose
Computing innovation can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended (ex: world wide web, targeted advertising, machine learning and data mining)
Some of the ways computing innovations can be sued may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
### Actions
Harmful/Beneficial Effects of Computing 1) The internet allows for easy access and sharing of information. However, problems involve hacking and misleading information. Social media, like Instagram, allows people to share their photos and experiences with other people from a distance. However, problems involving addition and cyber bullying arose from this invention. Online video games allow people to play games online with people from around the world. However, problems involving addiction, cyber bullying, and eye strain arose from this. 2) Dopamine is a types of neurotransmitter that your body makes. It is used to send messages between nerve cells. Dopamine applies to the pleasure aspect of our brain. When we use technology or social media, dopamine is often released, causing us to create a positive connotation with technology and social media, ultimately causing addition and neglect from reality.
## 5.2 Notes
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
The digital divide reverse to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
### Actions 
People empower themselves in the digital world through the use of technology, involving the use of computers, cell phones, and TVs. This technology allows us to communicate with others across the world, and escape from reality through videos, movies, or games. 2) Someone who is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by sharing their knowledge and skills that they have learned through using technology. Someone who is empowered can also help to provide technology for those who don’t have access to it. Something I can do at Del Norte HS is allow a student who doesn’t have access to a laptop to use my school laptop since I have a personal one. I can also teach those who are not confident in using technology the basics of how to navigate through a computer and canvas. 3) Paper/red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are such barriers preventing students from having the same opportunities and technological benefits as others. Barriers causing the digital divide will always present around the world, which includes barriers like poverty and resources.

## 5.3 Notes
- Computing innocations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
### Actions
No, the owner does not thought think it was intentional. This is because whe felt that the raicsm is caused by the lack of diversity in the developers. The HP functionality worked out this way because most coders are males and white and when coding, they were using themselves as a testing data set. This is harmful because it is not representative of the World Population. It wasn't not intended to be harmful though. It should be correct. We can increase the scope and racial diversity of the data to produce a better outcome
## 5.4 Notes
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, developments of solutions, and dessemination of results
- Science has been affect by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scienctists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding
### Actions
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One Crowdsource idea is to work together to make an AP CSP forum where students can get rapid feedback on their code.
2. Del Norte crowsources with grading through the peer grading process that AP science classes use. My final project could be better with crowsourcing as if I got more people to research how to code the forum, it would create a resource where many people can help others in a short frame of time. 
## 5.5 Notes
- Material made on a computer is intellectual property of the creator or organization
- Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concernss regarding ownership, value and use
- Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property
- The use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one's own plagiarism and may have legal consequences
- Some examples of legal ways to use materials created by someone else include:
- Creative Commons - a public copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. This is used the the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use, and build upon the work they have created
- open source - online research outputs free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
-the use of material made by someone should be cited
-Creative Commons, open source and open access have enavled broad access to digital information
- Legal and ethical concerns when using computing to harm individuals or groups
- Computing can play role in social and political issues 
- Digital Divide causes ethical concerns about computing
- Streaming software = legal and ethical concerns
### Actions
1. PII that we include in our CSP projects is our names, contact info, what school we go to, our previous projects/assignments.
2. I think that I am not very exposed, that there is little to none bad PII about we accessible to the public (or through nefarious methods)
3. A good password is long, random, and uses alphanumerics + special symbols. A bad password is short and easy to guess.
4. Symmetric encryption only uses 1 (private) key, and is faster but less secure. Asymmetric encryption is a more modern method that uses 2 keys (public and private), which takes longer but is more secure.
5. When we deploy, we encode private information about the machine and user that made the deployment, such as IP address.
6. When I was younger, I used to believe ads or emails that said something like "Click here for a million Gems!" (in some game). Though I never gave away any private information, I did believe that these were serious/legitimate methods. Other phishing examples would be "winning" a sweepstake or a lottery, but to access it you need to provide your bank account info.
## 5.6 Notes
- Personally identifiable information is infomration about an individual that finds links, relates or describes them
- Search engines can record history of searches
- Websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have viewed their pages
- Devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user's location
- Technology enables the collected, use, and exploitation of information
- A malicious link can be disguised on web page or email
- phishing, keylogging, rogue access point are something to be wary of
- unsolicited emails, attachments, links and forms in emails can be used to compromise the security of a system
- untrustworthy (often free) downloads can have malware.
### Actions
1. I think that if I wanted to make a profit off of my projects, I would use something like the Open Source MIT license, which would allow me to sell closed source versions of it. If I wanted my projects to be available to everyone and free to use, I would use Creative Commons 0 or GPL.
2. The license I have chosen for my personal GitHub pages is GNU GPLv3, because I want people to be able to use the information I provide without having to pay for it. Since this material is educational, I want people to easily access it, which is easiest to do with GPL. This license also allows people to modify or add on to my project, and also make those projects open source and free to use by other people. The license our team selected for our group project, managed by Mr. Mortensen, is
