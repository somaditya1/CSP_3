## 5.1 Notes
Essential Knowledge (Video 1):

People create computing innovations
The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
A signal effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts Essential Knowledge (Video 2):
Computing innovations can have an impact beyond its intended purpose
Computing innovation can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended (ex: world wide web, targeted advertising, machine learning and data mining)
Some of the ways computing innovations can be sued may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
### Actions
Harmful/Beneficial Effects of Computing 1) The internet allows for easy access and sharing of information. However, problems involve hacking and misleading information. Social media, like Instagram, allows people to share their photos and experiences with other people from a distance. However, problems involving addition and cyber bullying arose from this invention. Online video games allow people to play games online with people from around the world. However, problems involving addiction, cyber bullying, and eye strain arose from this. 2) Dopamine is a types of neurotransmitter that your body makes. It is used to send messages between nerve cells. Dopamine applies to the pleasure aspect of our brain. When we use technology or social media, dopamine is often released, causing us to create a positive connotation with technology and social media, ultimately causing addition and neglect from reality.
## 5.2 Notes
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
The digital divide reverse to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
### Actions 
People empower themselves in the digital world through the use of technology, involving the use of computers, cell phones, and TVs. This technology allows us to communicate with others across the world, and escape from reality through videos, movies, or games. 2) Someone who is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by sharing their knowledge and skills that they have learned through using technology. Someone who is empowered can also help to provide technology for those who don’t have access to it. Something I can do at Del Norte HS is allow a student who doesn’t have access to a laptop to use my school laptop since I have a personal one. I can also teach those who are not confident in using technology the basics of how to navigate through a computer and canvas. 3) Paper/red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are such barriers preventing students from having the same opportunities and technological benefits as others. Barriers causing the digital divide will always present around the world, which includes barriers like poverty and resources.

5.3 Notes
Computing innocations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
5.4 Notes
Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, developments of solutions, and dessemination of results
Science has been affect by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scienctists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding image

Week 1 TPT Actions
Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
When the computer saves your password, you won't have to worry about forgetting it but your computer is easier to hack
Online AP exams are great in a pandemic but not accessible to those affected by the Digital Divide
A smart home can make things easier but can be hacked
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
The Dopamine issues are real. I used to be distracted by reading books instead of doing my homework and a good schedule helped me address this problem
Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by having access to devices like computers, phones, and tablet. Something that will empower people even more is knowledge of cybersecurity and coding.
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Something we could do at Del Norte HS is teach free coding classes to people who cannot afford such classes/don't have access to them.
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Yes, paper and red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At school, the wifi blocks certain websites. In some countries like Russia, the government censors websites and foreign content that impedes on people's digital empowerment.
Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3
No, the owner does not thought think it was intentional. This is because whe felt that the raicsm is caused by the lack of diversity in the developers. The HP functionality worked out this way because most coders are males and white and when coding, they were using themselves as a testing data set. This is harmful because it is not representative of the World Population. It wasn't not intended to be harmful though. It should be correct. We can increase the scope and racial diversity of the data to produce a better outcome

Crowdsourcing 5.4
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? One Crowdsource idea is to work together to make an AP CSP forum where students can get rapid feedback on their code.
Del Norte crowsources with grading through the peer grading process that AP science classes use. My final project could be better with crowsourcing as if I got more people to research how to code the forum, it would create a resource where many people can help others in a short frame of time.
