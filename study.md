## 5.1 Notes
Essential Knowledge (Video 1):

People create computing innovations
The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
A signal effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts Essential Knowledge (Video 2):
Computing innovations can have an impact beyond its intended purpose
Computing innovation can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended (ex: world wide web, targeted advertising, machine learning and data mining)
Some of the ways computing innovations can be sued may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
### Actions
Harmful/Beneficial Effects of Computing 1) The internet allows for easy access and sharing of information. However, problems involve hacking and misleading information. Social media, like Instagram, allows people to share their photos and experiences with other people from a distance. However, problems involving addition and cyber bullying arose from this invention. Online video games allow people to play games online with people from around the world. However, problems involving addiction, cyber bullying, and eye strain arose from this. 2) Dopamine is a types of neurotransmitter that your body makes. It is used to send messages between nerve cells. Dopamine applies to the pleasure aspect of our brain. When we use technology or social media, dopamine is often released, causing us to create a positive connotation with technology and social media, ultimately causing addition and neglect from reality.
## 5.2 Notes
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
The digital divide reverse to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
### Actions 
People empower themselves in the digital world through the use of technology, involving the use of computers, cell phones, and TVs. This technology allows us to communicate with others across the world, and escape from reality through videos, movies, or games. 2) Someone who is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by sharing their knowledge and skills that they have learned through using technology. Someone who is empowered can also help to provide technology for those who don’t have access to it. Something I can do at Del Norte HS is allow a student who doesn’t have access to a laptop to use my school laptop since I have a personal one. I can also teach those who are not confident in using technology the basics of how to navigate through a computer and canvas. 3) Paper/red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are such barriers preventing students from having the same opportunities and technological benefits as others. Barriers causing the digital divide will always present around the world, which includes barriers like poverty and resources.
